**Background**
Investors are asking the team at Citibike to pitch the ridesharing program in NYC. 
Myself and the team have created a Tableau Dashboard and Story to illustrate why this is a good idea. 

**Results**
Checkout Times for Users was most prevalent during rush hour which could be widely attributed to the increased number of people looking to travel at that time. the numbers indicate that approximately 150,000 bikes are checked out during those times. 

Check out times by gender indicates that men are more inclined to rent bikes over their females and unknown coutnerparts by nearly 3 times the amount. 

Trips by gender ilustrates a heat map that supports that men rely on the bikesharing program significantly more than females, especially during the hours of 7:00AM - 9:00AM, as well as 5:00PM - 7:00PM. 

**Summary**
Curently, it can be supported that the population of users is primarily men relying on the bike sharing program during communiting hours to an from work Tuesday through Friday.
